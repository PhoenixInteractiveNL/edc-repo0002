DMGBoy 1.0 (2012-10-19)
* Added a OpenGL renderer. This decrease the use of the cpu when the size of the window is bigger than 1.
* Added fullscreen mode (only in the OpenGL mode)
* Improved the audio in Linux
* Improved the stability in computers with poor performance
* Improved the internal timer
* Improved interruptions
* Other minor improvements in accuracy
* Changed the default keys to Up, Down, Left, Right, A, S, Shift, Return. This change is because most of the keyboards can't
notify the press of 4 keys in the previous configuration. And The Legend of Zelda requires that A, B, Select,
Start keys are pressed to save the game
* Fixed bug in the MBCs
* Fixed bug in the SBC instruction (The sprite of the main character in the game Battletoads is rendered properly)
* Fixed the E8, F8 instructions
* Visual C++ 2010 redistributable included in the windows installer (no need to download it)
