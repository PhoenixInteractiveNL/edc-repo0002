  -- Plugins are now fully configurable from the GUI.
     The system's user interface is very similar to PsemuPro's plugin
     system. It was inspired by PsemuPro, but the dll specs are different.
     As other N64 emulators become compatible to this system, you can simply
     drop the new plugin dlls into your "Plugin" subfolder. In the future, you can 
     expect to see a lot of plugins to choose from :). 

     Currently, only the 1964 video plugins are to zilmar's plugin specifications.
     Input and audio still use 1964 specs but will be converted to the new specs soon.

  -- Users can switch to NooTe_D3D from GUI. The Direct3D is still early in dev,
     so expect gfx issues. However, NooTe_D3D has several options including:
        -- Full Screen
        -- Resolution Switching
        -- The return of cfb. If you wish to enable VI, disable HLE, and vice-versa.
        -- More; see NooTe_D3D.txt for more info

  -- A bonus game! CoinSweeperGL by Emul8or included. See coinsweep.txt in bonus subfolder 
     for more info.
