| v0.4.5 (May 15, 2000)     |
|___________________________|
  -- Major graphics improvements; Fixed up TLB support; Improved interrupts.

  -- Included in this build is version 0.0.1 of our own hle graphics plugin. The filename is 1964ogl.dll.
     For additional version information about our dll, right click on the dll file and select "Properties".
     In the near future, Corn, TR64 and TRWin will have their own graphics plugins as well and we will 
     eventually all be compatible.

  -- The dll plugin system also allows us to release new 1964 graphics dll versions to you even before new
     1964.exe releases are available.

     Playable Titles:
     Super Mario64 
     =============
         - issues: Pressing the start button to pause the game will freeze;
                   Game will also freeze after completing level 1 and returning
                   to the castle. I hope to have these problems fixed by the next release.
     Mario Kart
     ==========
          - Playable, but with serious graphics issues.

     Rampage
     =======
          - Playable as it was in v0.4.0..but known to freeze after a while.

     I don't own many games, so I don't know that much else works.

  -- As in the last release, v0.4.5 uses a "safe" dynarec method. I will
      gradually move back to the faster method which means speed will continue to improve.
