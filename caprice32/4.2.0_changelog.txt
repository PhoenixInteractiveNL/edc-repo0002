Changes - 14th May 2005
-----------------------

v4.2.0

 - New CRTC Type 0 emulation based on code by Richard Wilson.  The good:
   the new emulation is much closer to what the hardware does.  The bad:
   the new code is not yet optimized, still has some bugs, and due to the
   higher accuracy is quite a bit slower than the old CRTC emulation...

 - Stephane contributed code to render the CPC screen in a variety of
   different modes, e.g. scanlines, doubled, half size, Super Eagle,
   Scale2x, TV 2x and several OpenGL options.  See README.txt for the
   complete list.

 - Modified the sound playback code.  When sound is enabled, the emulator
   timing is now based on when the next sound buffer is ready.

 - Completely new keyboard code to support different international
   layouts and the mapping of the CPC keys to them.  Eventually the key
   assignments (CPC keys _and_ emulator functions) will be user definable
   via the GUI.

 - Return of the joystick emulation via the keyboard.  Can be enabled
   (and disabled) via CTRL+F8; replaces Z, X and the cursor keys with the
   joystick fire buttons and directions respectively.

 - Added support for ROM slots 0 and 1 - kudos to Anthony Jordan for
   pointing out that they should be user definable too!
