v4.1.0
June 18, 2004

 - emulator can now run in either fullscreen or windowed mode, with the
   possibility to switch between them at run time

 - added command line parsing: pass dsk/sna/cdt/voc images (as is or
   zipped) to the emulator and they are processed as necessary

 - added FPS display

 - lots of behind-the-scene changes to make Caprice32 compile and run
   "out of the box" on Linux (thanks Stephane & Jurgen!)
