V 0.99g2: Open Source release
-----------------------------
- ok, I've worked on the Linux version again, it has been quite a long time,
hasn't it ? So, the story might be a little confusing for you now : if you
read the history file of the DOS version, you will see that the most advanced
Linux version has been numbered 099h. So, why a return to 099a, 099b, and now
099g2 ? Simply because two or three years ago, a nasty Windows installation
destroyed my Linux partition. At that time, the DOS version was already more
advanced than the linux one, so I couldn't recover from the current DOS version.
Then time passed by, and it seems I forgot what happened when building the new
web site... So, when building the new web site, I built a Linux release from
what I had on my Linux partition : release 099a. Then, at some time, Thierry
must have asked me to include 65C02 support in the Linux version, this gave
a release 099b, not synchronized with the 099b release for DOS (I shouldn't
have numbered it this way...). And yesterday, as I was reading through the
DOS history file, I remembered the Linux version had come up to 099h.
Looking on my DOS archive revealed I don't have a copy of this release, but I
still have a copy of the 099g release. So, I have recompiled this 099g under
Linux, updated some assembly files to conform with the new syntax of the
assembler, simplified the keyboard handler so that it uses the routines in
SVGAlib instead of re-inventing the wheel, and voila !
- the second thing is that I am now providing the source code of Euphoric on
an Open Source basis. Open Source might not be the exact legal terms to use,
I haven't compared the terms with GPL and other licenses, the philosophy is
just that everybody is allowed to contribute to Euphoric for Linux, of course
it would be nice if all contributors share the same views. On the other hand,
I (Fabrice Frances) don't allow anyone to build a product containing Euphoric's
code without mentionning these sources. Well, you got the picture...
