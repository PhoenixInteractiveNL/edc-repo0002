Version 2.0 Alpha 6	13-June-2004

Debugger
- Added total cycle display (T) plus a clear button. This eases development of time critical assembler, and can be used to measure the time taken for particular routines.
- Scrolling the disassembler pane no longer changes the current selected instruction.
- Focus available in the Stack pane. (Still need to fix keyboard scrolling).

Assembler
- Fixed a bug which ocurred when a breakpoint was set at the start address of assembled code.
- Fixed the output to display the correct values in expressions etc at the end of a line.

Configuration Screen
- Fixed a bug which caused the Open and Save buttons for the keyboard file to sometimes display at the wrong time.
- Added archive (ZIP etc) support to the ROM and Cartridge selections.

Tape Emulation
-Added an Eject button to the tape control.
- Added archive (ZIP etc) support for tapes.
- Added tape sound output. (Will add a volume control later).
- Fixed enable/disable of Rewind, Press Play and Remove menu items for tape.

Emulation
- Moved all Z80 core code to a separate Pascal Unit. This will allow it to be used for other emulators.
- Fixed emulation support for the “Disable All ROMs” checkbox in the configuration screen. This does not disable ROM 7 from the internal CPC Plus cartridge since it may cause some cartridges not to work properly.
- Adjusted Sleep() time used. This reduces the CPU usage from 100% on faster machines, and “shouldn’t” cause any problems.
- Fixed a memory mapping bug which cause CP/M Plus not to boot.
