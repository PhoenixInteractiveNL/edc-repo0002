4.7.1 to 4.7.2: (Mar. 25, 2016)

  * Fixed bug when entering and exiting the debugger; sometimes the
    character corresponding to the '`' key would be output in the
    prompt area.

  * Updated DPC+ Thumb ARM emulation code to latest from David Welch.
    In particular, this fixes incorrect handling of the V flag when
    adding and subtracting, but also fixes compile-time warnings that
    I couldn't get rid of before.

  * Updated UNIX configure script to work with GCC 6.x compilers, and to
    remove references to obsolete compiler versions that can no longer
    be used to compile Stella.

-Have fun!
