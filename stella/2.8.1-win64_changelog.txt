2.8 to 2.8.1: (June 19, 2009)

  * NOTE: Windows users will have to reset their options or manually move
    their config folder in this release, since the location of the config
    files has changed.

  * Fixed OpenGL issue for some Windows users whereby the OpenGL TV
    effects weren't available, even if the available version of OpenGL
    was sufficient.  Related to this, the OpenGL version found by
    Stella is now reported in the TV effects dialog.

  * Added fallback to software rendering when OpenGL rendering has been
    requested, but for whatever reason fails to initialize.

  * Added native support for 4in1, 8in1 and 32in1 multicart bankswitching
    schemes.  When using these schemes, the 'Reload ROM' action
    (by default, Control-r) will switch between each game in the ROM.

  * Added bankswitch support for ROMs smaller than 2K in size.  These
    will be treated as 2K ROMs natively, without having to manually
    'pad' them to 2048 bytes.

  * Added preliminary suppport for autodetection of X07 bankswitching.

  * Tweaked PAL autodetection; it was marking some PAL ROMs as NTSC.

  * Changed default location for Stella config files in Windows to
    the users' APPDATA folder (for XP and Vista, this is
    '~/Application Data/Stella').  The '~' symbol now represents the
    users PROFILE/home directory, matching its usage in Linux and OSX.
    The ability to override this with 'basedir.txt' is still
    available, but not advised.

  * Changed '-exitlauncher' commandline argument to '-uselauncher'.
    This works as before except the launcher is never used at all if
    the option is set to false.

  * Fixed crash when launching Stella from the commandline and giving
    a directory name instead of a rom filename.
