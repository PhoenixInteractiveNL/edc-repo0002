2.7.2 to 2.7.3: (Feb. 9, 2009)

  * Fixed rendering issues in software mode when using 24-bit colour depth.
    This isn't as fast as 16 or 32-bit modes, so you're recommended to use
    one of those whenever possible.

  * For the Win32 port: re-added ability to change the default location
    for storing Stella config files.  To use this, simply create a file
    named 'basedir.txt' in the application directory containing the full
    path where all Stella-related items should be stored.

  * Tweaked the TIA info statistics overlay to be smaller while still
    including all relevant information.

-Have fun!
