1.4.1 to 1.4.2: (February 19, 2005)

  * Updated the sound system. All popping and cracking sounds that previously
    occurred at program start/stop and when entering/exiting menu or pause
    mode have been eliminated.
 
  * Fixed the gl_fsmax argument to mean "switch to desktop resolution on
    fullscreen OpenGL", instead of to the maximum possible resolution (the two
    are not always the same).
 
  * Added Alt [ and Alt ] keys to dynamically adjust the sound volume during
    emulation.
 
  * Added Control 0, Control 1, Control 2, Control 3 keys to dynamically change
    which paddle the mouse should emulate.
 
  * Added video_driver argument. This accepts the different options that can be
    specified for SDL_VIDEODRIVER (see SDL homepage for more information).
    Basically, it eliminates the need to set the SDL_VIDEODRIVER environment
    variable.
 
  * Made sure screen is refreshed before taking a snapshot.  This eliminates
    the problem with new snapshots containing the text "Snapshot saved".

  * For the Windows port; added windib and directx as options for
    'video_driver' when using software rendering. The 'windib' option is now
    the default, and in many cases it's up to 10 times faster than using
    'directx'.

  * For the OSX port; added 'Cmd-R' key to reload the currently loaded ROM.
