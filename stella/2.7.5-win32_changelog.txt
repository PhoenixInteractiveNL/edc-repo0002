2.7.3 to 2.7.5: (Mar. 27, 2009)

  * After about 2 years, finally fixed the infamous 'red screen' issue when
    using ATI video cards in OpenGL mode in Windows.  In the end, it was
    determined to be a bug in the ATI drivers.  Special thanks go to
    Ant (http://aqfl.net) for bugtesting and constant feedback wrt this bug.

  * Fixed bug in TIA SCORE mode emulation when the Priority bit is also
    set.  This fixes a very noticable graphical glitch in 'Swordquest
    Waterworld', as well as minor glitches in several other ROMs such
    as 'Space Shuttle'.

  * Treat spaces as normal characters in the ROM launcher.  This means
    that ROMs with spaces can be located with quick selection (ie,
    typing characters will automatically jump to a ROM with that name,
    and typing 'space' won't cause the launcher to jump back to the top
    of the list).

  * The debugger window can now have a minimum height of 620 lines
    (previously the minimum was 690), but you lose access to the TIA 'RAM'
    bytes when using this resolution.  This should allow it to work
    better on devices with small displays.
