2.7.5 to 2.7.6: (April 14, 2009)

  * Added support for 'EF' bankswitching (Paul Slocum Homestar Runner),
    as well as auto-detection of this format.

  * Added support for 'EFSC' bankswitching, as well as auto-detection of
    this format.  This is similar to the 'EF' scheme, but also includes
    128 bytes SuperChip RAM.

  * Added autodetection for '0840' and 'SB' bankswitching formats.

  * Improved autodetection for 'UA' bankswitching format.

  * Fixed bug in selecting video modes larger than the current screen;
    the resulting video mode will now be the largest one available
    (previously it selected the smallest one available).

  * The currently selected CPU register now displays its value in
    decimal and binary (in addition to hex) in the debugger.

-Have fun!
