3.2 to 3.2.1: (August 25, 2010)

  * Improved behaviour of joystick 'hat' movement.  This should fix bugs
    most visible in Yars' Revenge.

  * Fixed bug in debugger rewind states; bankswitching wasn't being
    performed during the rewind.  Related to this, fixed a similar issue
    with the debugger 'loadstate' and 'savestate' commands.

  * Added game properties info and snapshot for the newly released
    'Halo 2600' ROM.
