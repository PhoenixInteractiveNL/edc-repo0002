1.4.2 to 2.0: (October 16, 2005)

  * Added integrated GUI.  Stella is now a fully graphical application, and all
    settings can be changed dynamically while the application is running.  That
    means the commandline is no longer required (but support is still there
    for those who want to use it).

  * Added ROM launcher.  You can now exit a game and start playing another one
    from directly within Stella (you no longer have to quit Stella and
    restart it).

  * Because of the integrated GUI and ROM launcher, StellaX and KStella
    (the Windows and Linux frontends) have been discontinued.  The OSX
    port now uses the launcher as well.

  * Added an integrated debugger for game developers.  This is currently
    the first version of a debugger in Stella, but it's already quite
    usable.

  * Added new sound subsystem, which is much faster and more accurate.
    Related to this, added stereo sound output (used by some homebrew games).

  * Added ZIP support.  Stella can now open ROM's compressed in zip
    format.

  * Added cartridge 'frying', thanks to Fred "batari" Quimby.  This
    emulates the action of turning the power button on and off on a
    real Atari, often resulting in some strange effects.

  * Added ability to edit current ROM properties from directly within
    Stella, which can then be saved directly into the 'user.pro' file.
    So creating a properties entry for a new ROM can be done without
    any external tools.

  * Added initial support for using Stella in an 'arcade-box'
    environment without a keyboard.  This consists of an in-game
    menu for choosing common actions in Stella, as well as using the
    joystick navigate the mouse pointer.

  * Reworked properties system to use both a system-wide 'stella.pro' and
    a per-user 'user.pro' properties files.  Changes made by the user
    and stored in 'user.pro' are no longer erased when upgrading Stella.

  * Added support for cartridges with 3E bankswitching format.

  * Added preliminary Cheat support.

  * Added 'Alt/Shift-Cmd' z, x, c, v, b, n keys to enable/disable the
    P0, P1, M0, M1, BL, PL bits in the TIA, respectively.

  * Added 'Alt/Shift-Cmd .' key to disable all bits in the TIA.

  * Added 'Alt/Shift-Cmd /' key to enable all bits in the TIA.

  * Added 'Alt/Shift-Cmd g' key to switch dynamically switch between
    software and OpenGL modes while Stella is running.

  * Added 'Ctrl/Cmd r' key to reload the ROM currently being emulated.

  * Added 'Alt/Shift-Cmd s' key to merge the current game properties
    into the properties file.

  * Added 'help' commandline argument.  Launching Stella from the
    commandline with no options now starts Stella in ROM launcher mode,
    instead of showing help (as in previous versions).

  * Added the following commandline arguments for developers:
    "pro, type, ld, rd, tv, lc, rc, bc, format, xstart, ystart, width
    height, cpu, hmove".  Developers can consult the manual for
    further details.

  * Removed 'mergeprops' commandline argument, since there are now
    dedicated keys to either save or merge game properties.

  * Removed 'hidecursor' commandline argument.  Stella will now
    automatically decide when to use this setting.

  * Fixed framerate when switching between NTSC and PAL modes.  Stella
    now uses the correct framerate based on the format of the ROM,
    in terms of both video and audio.

  * Added 'configure' support to the build process for both Linux and
    Win32 (using MinGW).  Developers can now use the familiar 'configure;
    make; make install' commands to compile Stella.

  * Further consolidation and integration of SDL.  This should lead to
    faster operation and a more consistent look for all ports.

  * Fixed some 64-bit issues.  Stella now compiles and runs correctly
    on AMD64 and PPC64 Linux systems.

  * Updated the Stella manual with pictures of the new integrated GUI.
