2.5 to 2.5.1: (April 9, 2008)

  * Fixed M6532 RIOT timer emulation.  More testing is needed, but the
    changes so far have fixed several ROMs that didn't work before.

  * Fixed issue with weird characters in the debugger disassembly when
    loading .lst files.

  * Fixed bug where entering the debugger for 4A50 and E0 carts caused
    the ROM to be frozen afterwords.

  * Removed logic whereby starting a ROM from something other than the
    built-in launcher wouldn't allow the user to go back to the ROM launcher.

  * Fixed bug (hopefully) with the app icon not showing on the Stella window.
    Further testing is needed, since I can't duplicate the error myself.

  * Fixed default snapshot folder issues; the folder will now be
    automatically created in the same place as state folders, ini files,
    etc (whereever that may be for your platform).

  * Re-added 'lastrom' functionality, where Stella will remember and
    auto-select the last ROM that was successfully launched in the ROM
    launcher.

  * For Stella developers, fixed SpeakJet emulation so it compiles again.
    No improvements have been made to the emulation itself, though.
