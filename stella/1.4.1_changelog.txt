1.4 to 1.4.1: (August 15, 2004)

  * Fixed PAL sound issues.  PAL games now should sound correct (no distortion
    or missing sounds), but some games may still run too fast.  This is still
    a work-in-progress, and will be fixed in Stella 1.5.

  * Cleaned up the SDL event gathering loop.  This should hopefully fix the
    problems with "double-pumping events" reported by some Windows users.
    Event gathering and dispatching is now much faster as well.

  * Fixed a bug where the Control or Alt keys could be assigned to some event,
    but they could never be used.  Control/Alt can now be used for any event.

  * Updated stella.pro file to work with the latest Good2600 ROMset release
    (Thanks go to Voch for helping to maintain the stella.pro file).

  * For the Windows port; removed requirement for ROM files to be named *.bin
    in the StellaX frontend.  The ROM's can now have any name, but ZIP-files are
    not yet supported.

  * For the Windows port; fixed the problems with the included modified SDL
    library and Windows 98 users.  Stella should now run in Windows 98.

  * For the OSX port; added preference to allow user to select the directory
    in which ROM images are stored.  This sets the default directory to start
    the browsing for a ROM in, and doesn't preclude the user from selecting a 
    file outside that directory.

  * For the OSX port; fixed preferences bug where Preferences changed before
    a game was opened were not being saved.

  * For the OSX port; fixed an issue which would prevent the program from
    working with OSX 10.1.
