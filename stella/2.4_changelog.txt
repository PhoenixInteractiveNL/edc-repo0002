2.3.5 to 2.4: (August 20, 2007)

  * Added new video sub-system where fullscreen and windowed modes are treated
    differently.  Windowed modes now use '-zoom_tia' and '-zoom_ui' arguments,
    while fullscreen modes can be specified by resolution using the new
    '-fullres' argument.

  * Widescreen video modes are now supported; Stella will simply center the
    image with surrounding black borders.

  * Many UI-related changes, including resizable ROM launcher and debugger
    windows, and a new UI palette (the previous 'classic' palette is still
    available).  This is still a work in progress.

  * The locations of all major config files (statedir, palette file,
    cheat file, properties file, etc) are now configurable from the
    commandline and within the UI.

  * Updates to TIA palette support.  Added SECAM support, and removed the
    built-in 'original' palette.  Standard, z26, and user are still
    available.

  * Various bugfixes to some debugger commands.  The 'run' command no
    longer causes a crash, and several others have better error-checking.

  * Added more complete cartridge auto-detection for Commavid (CV), 3E,
    3F and Activision (FE) formats.

  * Removed XStart and Width ROM properties, since the forthcoming TIA
    rework won't be using them.

  * Reworked internal storage of ROM properties to be faster and take up
    less space.

  * Added several different ways of stretching the OpenGL image to the
    '-gl_fsmax' argument, for more flexibility.

  * Removed OpenGL aspect ratio setting favour of the previously mentioned
    video changes.  We'll see how this goes.

  * Removed dirty-rect support from software rendering, since it was actually
    sub-optimal in Windows and OSX and defaulted to off in previous versions.

  * Added support for gzipped ROMs.

  * Re-added pause support.

  * Re-added support for Windows 98.

  * Removed support for 'STELLA_BASEDIR' environment variable, since each
    config file can be now configured separately.

  * Removed '-fastscbios' argument, since it must always be turned on.

  * Removed PSP support, since it hasn't been updated in over a year, and
    someone else is maintaining another port elsewhere.

  * For the Unix/Linux port; fixed 'make install' issues, and changed icon to
    PNG format.
