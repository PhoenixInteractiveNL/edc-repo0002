2.5.1 to 2.6: (May 16, 2008)

  * Added AtariVox support using a real AtariVox device, where Stella
    sends data directly to the AtariVox.  For now, this is supported in
    Linux/UNIX, OSX, and Win32 only.  You'll obviously need a real
    AtariVox, and a serial<->USB adaptor to connect it to your system.
    Added '-avoxport' commandline argument used to set the serial port
    to which the AtariVox is connected.  Special thanks to Al Yarusso
    and Richard H. for providing sample hardware.

  * Added AtariVox and SaveKey EEPROM emulation.  This reads/writes data
    to a 32KB file, not to the actual hardware.  Very useful for testing
    EEPROM support without actually wearing out the real device.  Special
    thanks to J. Payson for providing the EEPROM emulation code, and A.
    Herbert for answering many driver-related questions.

  * Added support for CX-22, CX-80, and AmigaMouse trackball controllers.

  * Improved debugger symfile handling so that addresses accessed as
    read-only won't use write-only labels (and vice-versa).  More work
    is still needed in this area.

  * Added M6532/RIOT tab to the debugger.  This will be expanded on in a
    future release.

  * Added TIA emulation fixes for graphical glitches in Escape from the
    Mindmaster, Mission Survive, Solaris, and SWOOPS!

  * Fixed bug where fullscreen OpenGL scaling wasn't working on 4:3 monitors.

  * Further improvements to the M6532/RIOT emulation, which unfortunately
    have broken old state files (again).

  * Added deadzone setting, for adjusting the deadzone amount for
    analog joysticks.  This can be set using the commandline argument
    '-joydeadzone' or dynamically within the UI.

  * Make ROM disassembly in debugger take advantage of a wide window.

  * Fixed bug in 6507 BCD handling introduced in the last release.

  * For the Win32 port; Win9x should be fully supported again.
