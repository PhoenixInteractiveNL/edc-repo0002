2.6 to 2.6.1: (May 22, 2008)

  * Introduced more accurate timing for NTSC vs. PAL modes, where the
    framerate is based on the number of scanlines per frame.  This should
    eliminate 'clicking' sounds when emulating ROMs that don't follow
    the exact NTSC or PAL scanline specs.

  * Added ability to see the current number of scanlines and corresponding
    framerate to the TIA emulation.  This can be set with the '-stats'
    commandline argument, or dynamically turned on and off with the
    'Alt-l' key combo.

  * Modified '-framerate' commandline argument, where a non-zero value
    overrides the automatic framerate calculation (based on number of
    scanlines).  Setting 'framerate' to zero re-enables auto-frame
    calculation.  Also, re-enabled changing the framerate from within the
    UI.

  * Added '-timing' commandline argument, which sets the type of waiting
    between processing frames.  Setting it to 'sleep' emulates the
    previous behaviour in Stella; setting it to 'busy' emulates z26,
    and can in some cases eliminate screen tearing (at the expense of
    using all available CPU time).

  * Fixed issue with debugger disassembly and mirrored $40 TIA write
    addresses.  They were actually defined at $30, and generating incorrect
    labels.

  * Fixed issue in AtariVox and SaveKey controllers where accessing the
    EEPROM sometimes failed after the first write.

  * Changed AtariVox and SaveKey EEPROM emulation to default to $FF for
    a blank EEPROM.

  * Fixed regression in cart auto-detection logic; some F6 ROMs were being
    misdetected as E7.

  * Fixed issue with M6532/RIOT timer initialization; it was causing some
    ROMs to hang (most notably Summer Games).  Related to this, reworked
    the built-in random number generator to generate 'more' random numbers.

  * Fixed bug in CommandMenu where console buttons (Select, Reset, etc)
    weren't doing anything.
