2.8.3 to 2.8.4: (July 4, 2009)

  * Fixed bug where Stella could lock up after running for ~71 minutes.
    Special thanks to Robert Tuccitto for bugtesting and feedback on this
    issue.

  * Updated UA bankswitch autodetection for Gingerbread Man ROM.

  * The smallest ROM that Stella can support is 64 bytes; this lower
    limit is now tested when loading Sub2K ROMs.
