2.8.4 to 3.0: (September 11, 2009)

  * Huge updates to the TIA emulation system.  Illegal HMOVEs are now
    handled correctly, resulting in improvements to many ROMs (thanks
    to Wilbert Pol for many ideas and code for these improvements).  All
    HMOVE emulation 'cheats' were removed; the emulation is now cycle-exact
    in this area.

  * Improved emulation of the Cosmic Ark 'starfield effect', also used in
    Stay Frosty; the emulation now looks very accurate.

  * Many improvements to the normal TIA rendering code, fixing problems
    when disabling certain graphical objects (certain objects were
    being misdrawn when others were enabled/disabled).

  * Improved TIA collision handling in the non-displayable area of the
    screen; this fixes problems in RAMRacer ROM.

  * Improved TIA redraw problems/graphical garbage when ROMs generate
    many more scanlines than a real TV would allow; this fixes problems
    in Q-Bert and the recent Playaround demo.

  * Added 'Fixed Debug Colors' option similar to the no$26k emulator.
    This allows each graphical object to be drawn in a fixed color,
    more clearly showing how the objects interact.  HMOVE blanks are
    also shown in a different color.  The TIA now emulates a 7-color
    register model, allowing even shared objects to show different
    colors.  This is toggled with the 'Alt Comma' key.

  * Related to 'Fixed Debug Colors', HMOVE blanks can now toggled during
    TIA display with the 'Alt-m' key.

  * Added rewind functionality to the debugger, where states are saved
    after each step/trace/scanline/frame advance.  Pressing 'Alt-r' or
    clicking the new rewind button will undo up to 100 previous
    operations.

  * Added 'electron beam indicator' to the debugger TIA output.  Basically,
    this is a visual pointer indicating the position of the electron gun
    when scanning the display.

  * Added ability to completely disable fullscreen mode, which fixes
    problems for some people where fullscreen mode was being entered
    even if it wasn't enabled.

  * Added '-joyallow4' commandline argument and associated UI item to
    allow all 4 directions to be pressed simultaneously on a joystick.

  * Improvements made to the ROM launcher: the backspace key now goes
    to the parent directory (this key can be remapped), and previously
    selected directories are now automatically selected.

  * Added support for 2IN1 bankswitching scheme, where two ROMs are
    present in one binary.  Currently supported are 2, 4, 8, and 16K
    ROMs.

  * Added bankswitch support for the 6K version of Starpath/Supercharger
    ROMS.  This allows the 6K version of Cubis to run.

  * Updated bankswitching schemes FASC and MB; they are now known as
    FA and F0, respectively.  This naming brings Stella in line with
    other emulators and programming utilities.

  * Fixed editing of cheats in the Cheat Dialog; the old cheat wasn't
    being removed.

-Have fun!
