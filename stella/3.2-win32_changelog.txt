3.1.2 to 3.2: (August 20, 2010)

  * NOTE: because of the many event-related changes in this release, all
    event mapping should be reset to defaults after starting Stella for
    the first time.  As well, because of other internal changes, older
    save-state files are no longer valid.

  * Many improvements to joystick handling code, particularly for analog
    axes.  Navigating the UI should be much smoother now, and remapping
    events to analog axes should be less 'twitchy'.

  * Added ability to assign and remap 'combo' events in emulation mode.
    Combo events are basically a sequence of normal events (up to 8)
    that are generated from a single event (ie, one button on a joystick
    could generate up to 8 events).  Updated Input Settings UI to
    access and modify these events.

  * Default mappings are now available in UI and emulation mode for the
    first 'hat' detected on a joystick/gamepad.  Related to this, a hat
    now works exactly like an axis in UI mode (holding down a direction
    continues that direction until the hat is released/centered).

  * Several major improvements to the debugger:
      - the disassembler can now process multiple entry points, and
        caches entry points as they're encountered (ie, the disassembly
        isn't 'reset' each time a bank change occurs or you exit and
        re-enter the debugger)
      - preliminary support for disassembling from zero-page RAM
      - re-added ability to change banks with the 'bank' debugger
        prompt command and within the ROM disassembly UI
      - user labels in disassembly are now supported again
      - 'runto' command is now case-insensitive, and shows a progressbar
        while searching through the disassembly
      - the debugger window can be resized between ROM loads (previously,
        the app had to be restarted)
      - fixed bug in Distella disassembler output, where it sometimes
        generated addresses above $FFFF
      - a vertical line separates the disassembly from the raw bytes

  * Fixed behaviour of SWCHB and SWBCNT; pins set to output now remember
    the values previously written.  Some ROMs use this functionality for
    extra storage.  Special thanks to Omegamatrix of AtariAge for advice
    and test ROMs in this area.

  * Fixed bug when reading from illegal TIA addresses; a Space Invaders
    hack was showing pink enemies instead of white ones.  Again, special
    thanks to to Omegamatrix of AtariAge for advice and test ROMs in this
    area.

  * Fixed bug in handling INPT4/INPT5 latches from VBLANK; a least one
    ROM was working in Stella when it didn't on real hardware.

  * Added 'ramrandom' commandline argument, which is used to randomize
    all RAM in the system; otherwise, the RAM is zeroed.

  * Added 'finishing touches' to some of the UI descriptions, giving a
    better explanation of the functions.  Related to this, certain
    options now show a message box explaining the option in further
    detail (particularly the ROM Audit mode).  As well, when starting
    Stella for the first time, a prompt appears to select a ROM
    directory.

  * Fixed bugs in the ROM launcher when viewing certain PNG images not
    created by Stella.  Related to this, the official PNG library is now
    included in the Stella codebase (version 1.4.3).  Also added composite
    snapshots for those ROMs which consist of several games.  Thanks go
    to Buzbard of AtariAge for these images.

  * Added several fixes for crashes on 'small' systems (those systems
    where the maximum resolution is less than 640x480).

  * Tweaked bankswitch autodetection for 0840, DPC+, E7 and UA schemes.

  * Improved F8 bankswitch autodetection for Yars Revenge in 8in1 ROM.

  * Updated DPC+ bankswitch scheme to latest specifications.

  * Snapshots taken in continuous snapshot mode are now timestamped, so
    older files are never overwritten.

  * Fixed a TIA segfault that could occur with certain ROMs.

  * The 'center' application window functionality can now be changed
    without having to restart the application.  Related to this, mouse
    positioning bugs when using the Linux version in OpenGL mode with
    SDL 1.2.14 have been fixed.

  * Reworked the manual, dividing it into 'Getting Started' and
    'Advanced Configuration' sections.  It still contains the same info
    as before, but hopefully in a better organized way.

  * Updated Help dialog; it was showing incorrect info for some OSX
    shortcuts.

  * Updated OSX build script to not crash when a previous build is
    detected, and to properly handle filenames with spaces.

  * Updated included ZLib to latest release version (1.2.5).
