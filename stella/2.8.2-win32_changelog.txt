2.8.1 to 2.8.2: (June 23, 2009)

  * Fixed OpenGL detection bug which could disable OpenGL support entirely
    if TV effects are not available (version < 2.0), when in fact only the
    effects should have been disabled.

  * The '\' character can now be entered in UI text fields again.
    Related to this, strings containing '\' are now properly loaded and
    saved to various config files.
