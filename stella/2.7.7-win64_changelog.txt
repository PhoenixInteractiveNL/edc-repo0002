2.7.6 to 2.7.7: (May 1, 2009)

  * Corrected emulation of CPU opcodes involving 'decimal' mode (ADC/RRA
    and SBC/ISB).  Special thanks to SeaGtGruff and others on the Stella
    mailing list for in-depth discussion and creation of test ROMs.

  * Fixed bug in F4SC bankswitching mode; writes to bankswitch addresses
    weren't triggering a bank switch.

  * Changed internal sound frequency of Pitfall 2 from 15.75KHz to 20KHz,
    as this sounds much more authentic when compared to a real cartridge.
