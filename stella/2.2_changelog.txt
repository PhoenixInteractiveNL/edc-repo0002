2.1 to 2.2: (April 7, 2006)

  * Added new ROM browser option which works like a normal filesystem
    browser, allowing navigation throughout the filesystem.
    The old mode of browsing is still present, and can be toggled at
    runtime.  Related to this, fixed bug whereby sorting in the ROM
    launcher sometimes didn't work.

  * Integrated stella.pro properties into the application, resulting in
    faster startup time.  Now Stella can be redistributed as a single
    binary; no external files are needed, but they will still be used
    if present.

  * Reworked ROM properties files once again.  The 'user.pro' file has
    been removed, and all user-defined properties are stored in
    'stella.pro' instead.  You should delete all properties files when
    upgrading to this version, to take advantage of the speed increases.

  * Reworked settings files once again.  Removed all references to a
    global settings file.  Each user now gets a user-specific settings
    file only.  If that file doesn't exist, the built-in defaults are
    used.

  * Added 'conditional saving' of the cheatcode and settings files, so
    that these files are only written to disk when absolutely
    necessary.  This doesn't really affect desktop systems, but is very
    useful for systems with flashram-based storage (GP2X, WinCE, etc).

  * Reworked Settings class, hopefully fixing a bug whereby settings
    weren't being saved in certain cases (most evident in the OSX port).

  * Added 'tiadefaults' commandline option, which can also be toggled
    from within the GUI.  This option disables all TIA positioning
    'tweaks' that typically make a game look better, and present the
    image exactly as it would appear on a real 2600.

  * Added jitter-detection code for the paddle emulation, which should
    eliminate an annoying 'jittering' effect when using paddles with
    a Stelladaptor.

  * Related to jitter-detection, added '-pthresh' commandline option
    and GUI entry, which sets a bound below which the emulation detects
    jitter.

  * Fixed crash when adding one-shot cheats.

  * Fixed bug in RAM comparitive searches in the debugger.

  * Fixed bug with setting snapshot naming type from the GUI (it was
    always being set to 'romname').

  * Re-added low compatibility CPU emulation mode, since it benefits
    some slower systems.  This is activated with the commandline argument
    '-cpu low'.

  * For the OSX port, added Universal binary support.

  * For the OSX port, reworked the menu handling, so that certain menu
    options are only enabled when it makes sense to do so.

  * For the GP2X port, fixed joystick deadzone issues and scroll bug in
    ROM launcher.

  * For the GP2X port, fixed issue with PAL ROMs causing a crash because of
    screen size.  A message is now shown indicating that PAL ROMs are not
    yet supported.
