3.5 to 3.5.5: (February 4, 2012)

  * Due to changes in the debugger, old state files will not work with
    this release.

  * Fixed bug in sound restructuring introduced in the last release; in
    some cases, there could be some sound 'crackling' when starting a
    ROM after at least one ROM had already been loaded.

  * Several significant improvements to the debugger I/O tab:
      - added controller input widgets for many of the built-in
        controllers, allowing to control joysticks, paddles, etc
        from within the debugger.
      - added ability to modify the SWCHB/SWBCNT port B registers.
      - added ability to view TIA INPTx and VBLANK latch/dump bits.

  * Reworked 'mcontrol' argument, and added ability to map the mouse
    axes separately for paddles 0-3 or driving controllers 0-1.  In
    such modes, the left mouse button is tied to the x-axis, and the
    right button is tied to the y-axis.

  * Mouse 'specific-axis' mode is now saved per-ROM, meaning that each
    ROM can have separate settings.  For example, this allows one ROM to
    use paddles 0 and 1, while another can use paddles 0 and 2, etc.

  * The key-combo for switching the mouse between controller modes is now
    'Control-0' (Control-1,2,3 have been removed).  This switches
    between all possible modes for the current virtual controllers.

  * Fixed bug in 'Fixed Debug Colors' mode; under certain circumstances,
    playfield graphics could be coloured as being player graphics.

  * Fixed bug in PAL color-loss setting in Video Settings; changing the
    settings wouldn't take effect until the ROM was reloaded.

  * Fixed bugs with cheatcode handling; loading a ROM with a cheat
    disabled would sometimes trash the emulation.  More work is
    required in this area, including the ability to create more
    advanced types of cheats.

  * Updated ROM properties database for all Sega Genesis controller
    compatible ROMs.  Also, the mouse can now emulate a Genesis
    controller, with the left/right buttons mapped to buttons B and C,
    respectively.

  * Added 'FA2' bankswitch scheme, thanks to code from Chris D.
    Walton.  This scheme will be used in an upcoming 'Star Castle' ROM.

  * Updated internal ROM properties database to ROM-Hunter version 7
    (thanks go to RomHunter for his tireless research in this area).

  * Added several PERL tools to help in automation of analyzing RomHunter
    ROM set releases.

  * Fixed compile issues in Irix when using the default compiler
    instead of gcc.  Thanks go to Rainer M. Canavan for this code.

  * Updated included PNG library to latest stable version.

-Have fun!
