Changes :
# Adding a new debugger accessible by the menu (Command / Debug...)
  This debugger is self documented and fit in a resizeable window.
# Completely rewritten execution timing
  (Now a QL set a original speed use very few percent CPU time in
   both DirectX or GDI mode)
  It possible to set speed factor too from original QL Speed.
  To set speed factor use -P x switch where x is 1 for QL orginal speed,
  2 for 2 time quicker and so...
# A new switche has been added to set the delay of MDV from 31ms to 1ms.
  This switch is -Q.
# DirectDraw FullScreen mode doesn't show window border anymore
  We have left just the menu bar as often the ALT Key is locked by
  the emulator for QL usage.
# Many and many bugs fixes and code cleaning.
