Changes - 11th May 2013
-----------------------

- Various VIA6522 emulation tweaks (but shift register emulation is still a
  bit incorrect)
- Fixed dead lock bug in the high-tap-count SINC resampler SSE consolve
  inline assembler routine in the SID emulation.
- Various another small fixes.
- Added black frame insertion feature for >=100Hz monitors. (Untested,
  because I myself have no such monitor)
- Added BMP screenshot function, the BMP screenshot files will be stored
  under ~/.micro64/screenshots/ on linux and MacOSX systems and under
  <SystemDrive>:\Users\<User>\AppData\Roaming\micro64\screenshots\ on
  NT-based Windows systems. And the keyboard shortcut for screenshots is
  Alt+S
- Added AVI video capturing function with own Open-DML AVI writer and I420
  encoder routines, the AVI video files will be stored under
  ~/.micro64/videos/ on linux and MacOSX systems and under
  <SystemDrive>:\Users\<User>\AppData\Roaming\micro64\videos\ on NT-based
  Windows systems. And for this function is no keyboard shortcut, just the
  menu point in the main menu, for to avoid miss-started video captures.
- Made the source code compatible with Borland Delphi XE4 just for me for
  to work with the newer Delphi IDE on micro64, so the public release
  binaries were, are and will be still in future compiled with FreePascal.
