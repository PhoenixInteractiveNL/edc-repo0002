Notes:
  * The database is updated after install if found.
   This may take several seconds depending on how
   big the database is. Trying to go backwards to 0.6.2 with
   an updated database may result in crash. If you have spent
   considerable effort creating your config, I suggest backing 
   up the kat5200.db3 file just in case. 

  * Sound under Linux with ALSA is not good with SDL.
   Install PulseAudio and set the appropiate SDL 
   environment variable (SDL_AUDIODRIVER=pulseaudio).

  * Windows users need to install the Visual C++ 2015
   redistributable (x86 version). Get here:
