Changes in KEGS v0.86 since v0.85 (03/23/04)
- Add patch for Solaris sound by Jonathan Kalbfeld.
- Fix so that F4 enters config panel even while running Prosel-16
- Major mouse pointer changes, based on some ideas from Geoff Weiss.
	The GSOS mouse now exactly tracks the host pointer automatically.
- Fixed an accidental debug halt when Prosel-16 disables the keyboard/mouse.
