Changes in KEGS v0.91 since v0.90 (12/06/04)
- Fixed serious bug in engine_c.c that could cause Finder file copies to
	silently corrupt data.
- Virtual Modem support--modem appears on serial port, allows outgoing
	and incoming connections.
- Sockets (and Virtual Modem) supported on Windows.
- Fixed various reset bugs (where pressing Ctrl-Reset would cause infinite
	beeps, etc).
- Allow user to select ROM file from config panel if not found.
- Improved Mac OS X interface: Full Screen support and error dialogs.
- Better floppy support by always having 5.25" read nearest track regardless
	of head position (supports Last Gladiator game bad crack by
