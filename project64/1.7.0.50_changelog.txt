(Project 64 1.7 + AQZ)

-Intro

Project64 1,7 wasn't publically released as it was always 'in beta stage', it was only given out to those who indirectly bought the emulator from the creators. 
Therefor two or three bootleg copies of the emulator got spread, one of which is registered by "TheMejorDe64", version 1.7.0.50. 
The reason why Project64 1.7 is used and not Project64 2.1 is because AQZ was specifically created for Project64 1.7 beta
and because of problems with timers, and fps with certain games such as Majoras Mask, where real time timers will not be 'real time' they will be faster/slower.
