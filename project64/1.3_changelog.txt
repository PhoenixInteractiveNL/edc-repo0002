Changes from 1.2 to 1.3:
------------------------


R4300i Core and Executable
- re-wrote a lot of the recompiler's fpu code
- changed one of the default sync rules
- changed default known state to 64bit from 32bit
- Fixed DADDU
- rewrote PI DMA
- removed some warning message boxes
- disabled being able to open a new rom when one is being opened
- re-wrote CPU%
- Auto Zip save states
- Better error control when opening save states
- screen saver should not start when running (I believe works fine)
- load/save as save states

Direct3D and OpenGL

- TMU has smaller data structures, which results in better access time
- TMU uses less timer functions, results in better access time
- Tweaked environment mapping a little
- Fixed tab orders in config dialog
- Fixed a texture loading problem that goes past memory (zelda64)
- Texture caching stability improved for invalid tiles (Tetrisphere)
- Rewrote handling of shade alpha, more microcode accurate
- the SSE vector dp3 and normalize calculations in lighting were optimized

OpenGL

- Benchmarked the plugin, made small optimizations
- Decal based on surface normals, thanks to a good book (Mario64)
- Fixed viewport flushes (WaveRace)

Direct3D

- Fixed modes: zelda2 - water in temple, paper mario - characters, turok - ground, castlevania - text, zelda64 - magic and sword, SF Rush - trees
- Fixed lots of strange problems from the Sister witch bosses, and ice cave in zelda64
- Support for Conker's Bad Fur Day
- Removed shading mode from reset, so its not modified
- Limited the iterations of Validate Blending to 4, shouldn't hang now
- Fixed alpha combiner, also most invalid 3-stage situations
- Rewrote filter handlers so the defines are correct
- The SSE vp and clipping calculation in the internal geometry functions were optimized
- Put display list culling in, it's fast and effective finally
- Allowed modulate to replace unsupported operations, might help Radeon cards a little bit
- Put in an exception handler, prevents crashing

Direct Input

- Implemented 4 players
- Fixed tab orders in config dialog
- Library code updated to DirectX 7.0
- Can have multiple devices of the same name, it will select the proper one now in config

RSP Compiler

- Fixed alignment issues on a few GPR and Vector opcodes
- Implemented SRV, mp3 audio ucode will not hang now
- Fixed an issue with 0h element with MMX
- Took out some precautions on LDV and SDV

Direct Sound (J)

- Frequency changes happen dynamically, rather than recreating buffers, seems to be more stable in windows 2000
