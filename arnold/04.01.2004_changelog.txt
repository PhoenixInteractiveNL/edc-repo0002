Changes - 4th January 2004
--------------------------

General:
- new: now using CVS source control system. This is making development much much easier! :)

Core:
- fix: fixed I/O port decoding for RAM configuration PAL inside CPC6128; and for PAL integrated
  into CPC+ ASIC. Thankyou to Richard Wilson for his help.
- fix: fixed a bug in the RAM configuration which prevented Overflow's Backtro and C/PM+ from running.
- fix: sample loading: 16-bit samples were treated as unsigned, but they are 
  actually signed. fixed.
- fix: lots of fdc emulation bugs fixed
- fix: lots of bugs fixed in disc image output code; applies to inserting unformatted discs; 
  a lot of created images were bad!
  strange formats are mostly supported now.
- fix: write deleted data now marks sectors with deleted data control mark now!
- fix: all fdc commands supported including scan commands
- fix: multi-track function of fdc fully implemented
- new: support for DIF disk image (used by CPC++ emulator) [Richard Bannister]
- new: seperated floppy disc controller, floppy disc drive, and floppy disc interface code.
- fix: fixed decoding of disc controller I/O ports
- new: removed as many references to Host_LoadFile and Host_SaveFile from the core code.
(this allows the host to supply binary data which is included in executable, and allows
the host to use it's own load/save functions). 
- new: updated the load and save functions to return status code's which indicate an errors
(this allows the host code to return more meaningful error code's and messages;
or to even log them to a file)
- new: removed reference to Host_OpenFile and Host_CloseFile functions from printer code.
The host must now handle the printer output itself.
- new: removed cpcdefs.h file. Defines are build related and should be defined in the project/makefile for each port.
- new: auto-type helper feature; enter the text you want to type in and let the auto-type
feature do all the hard work for you :) Thankyou to Troels K for the first version which
he has in CPC Explorer/CPC Loader.
- new: auto-start helper feature; this feature will attempt to auto-start any image that
has been inserted. But, on the CPC there can be more than one way to run a program,
so this feature may not work with all discs. Try it and see :)

General interface functions:
- merged tape-image and sample handling code

CPC:
- fix: fixed keyboard problems in CPC mode.

CPC+:
- fix: fixed mirror of sprite X,Y coordinates in magnification registers
- fix: fixed sprite coordinates bugs. Simply the Best and Iron demo 3 will display exactly
  as on a real CPC+.

Windows version

Lots of user interface stuff to make Arnold easier to use :)
- new: roms moved to source distribution. Rom data is now built into executable.
- new: roms are integrated into executable. [Troels K, Andreas M, Richard B, Kev T]
- new: command-line supported; you can run arnold from the command line with various parameters.
- new: you can double click on a file to automatically launch Arnold (you must register the file

- new: you can double click on a file while Arnold is open, and it will be opened in Arnold.
- new: will detect if another instance of the application is running; you can choose to open

- new: now using Zlib libary for decompression of ZIP archives. (some old files compressed with PKZIP may

- new: executable compressed using UPX [Troels K]
- new: implemented file selection dialog for ZIP archives.
