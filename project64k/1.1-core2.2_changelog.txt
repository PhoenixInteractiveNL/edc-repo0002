Run the installer first. PLEASE BEWARE OF BLOATWARE which comes with the installer; recommend saying no/skip/cancel to the two choices. This was always part of the 2.2 installer; I did not add this.

Then, put kailleraclient.dll in the main directory.

Normal configuration and you should be good to go.

Currently seems to stay synced with all video, audio, and RSP plugins tested. Desynchs on random events with older input plugins. Strongly recommend using stock input plugin.

Known issues are documented in the issues section.
