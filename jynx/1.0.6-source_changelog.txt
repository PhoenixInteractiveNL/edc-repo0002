Enhanced support for TAP files to allow Level 9's DUNGEON ADVENTURE to load.
DUNGEON's on-line TAP files can be concatenated, in order, in HXD (or similar HEX editor) into a single TAP, and loaded automatically.
Screen colour selections added. Level 9 option supports the Level 9 adventure games, as they used the RED and BLUE screen memories to store data. I do not emulate the Lynx's ability to hide the RED and BLUE displays, so this menu is a work-around for these games. This gives a better user experience than on a real Lynx - no flicker!
Re-worked the "console" speed-up facility to work on the keyboard PORTs rather than Z80 ROM spying. This is better I think. The algorithm is slightly different, which I think works better as well. (This feature is for console input at Lynx-speed, with response at host-speed).
Added a new machine type to support the Lynx Scorpion ROM (lynx96-3-scorpion.rom). If you don't have this, just "copy lynx96-3.rom lynx96-3-scorpion.rom" with cmd.exe.
Improved emulation of cassette-PORT handling. I now require the level comparator to be set before I supply cassette data on bit 0 of port 80 reads, otherwise I supply keyboard data only. My slight mis-emulation of this caused Level9 software to fail because - believe it or not - the game keeps switching the cassette motor ON and OFF when it does its bank switching! (programming error on their part exposed programming error on mine!).
