Version 0.2a - 3/2/2012

New functionality:

*   Added text-based virtual printer output for all platforms
*   Added OSX drag/drop "installer" disk image (.dmg)
*   Disk images will automatically mount and boot when specified 
    as the last argument on the command line, or when invoked from 
    the Windows shell (file->open as GSport.exe)

Bug fixes:

*   Added sound and native printer libraries in Win32 binary, 
    mistakenly omitted
*   OSX: fixed some "endianness" troubles with the fat binaries
