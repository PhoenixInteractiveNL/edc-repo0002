Version 0.31 - 6/22/2014

New functionality:

*   Added AppleTalk networking emulation with bridging to 
    EtherTalk
*   Added clipboard text paste capability (OSX, Windows)
*   Emulated serial ports are individually configurable as 
    either IP or passthrough to real hardware ports
*   Added Imagewriter LQ printer emulation

Bug fixes:

*   IN#1 and IN#2 now trigger the incoming IP port to listen 
    when using IP simulated serial ports; previously, only 
    PR#1 or PR#2 did
*   Fixed crash when parallel.rom is missing
*   Fix for real joysticks: unless the joystick is moving, 
    gsport sets the values to zero.
