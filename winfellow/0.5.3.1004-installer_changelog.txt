What’s New in WinFellow 0.5.3?
------------------------------

Thanks for your interest in WinFellow. Compared to version 0.5.2 there are a
number of changes in this build, with the most significant ones being:

• New features:
– support for high DPI configurations, also when used together with Amiga Forever 2016
– support for the original Amiga 1000 boot process from Kickstart disk boot; configure the A1000 bootstrap ROM like any other ROM image for the feature to be automatically enabled
– support for keyboard-initiated reset - press Ctrl+Left Windows+Right Windows or Ctrl+Left Windows+Context Menu (as not all keyboards have a right Windows key) to initiate a reboot within an emulated session
– support for extended ROM images; this gives the ability to use the AROS boot ROM
– support for screenshots, clipping editor/live preview and scanlines in Amiga Forever

• Changed functionality:
– WinFellow is now compiled using Visual Studio 2013 Update 5
– the default configuration contains 512kB chip/bogo memory now and has the real-time clock active (Amiga 500 with A-501 expansion)
– the default configuration is now windowed and has LEDs active
– chip memory mirroring has been implemented for OCS chipsets; the change was required for compatibility reasons, as some titles rely on it
* because of this change, chip memory is now limited to 512kB when an OCS blitter has been configured; if you need to use more, please use the ECS Agnus blitter in your display configuration (it is an actual limitation of the OCS chipset)
– 2x mode in Amiga Forever now scales via DirectX instead of the internal draw modules (design change was necessary to enable live preview in 2x mode)

• Bug fixes:
– implemented bogo memory mirroring for ECS chipset with 512kB chip/bogo memory (required by the demo Move any Mountain)
– fix for CIA timer logic (fixes the game Atomix)
– fixes for several CPU instructions:
* ’020 bit-field instructions were re-implemented (fix for Lotus Esprit Turbo Challenge 96k)
* ASL instruction’s overflow detection was improved
* MULU flag check improved
– escape key special handling in Amiga Forever improved (some titles would not detect an escape key press before)
