 MEKA 0.68
 ---------
 Please report any problems you encounter. 
 Suggestions are always welcome.

  - Updated MEKA.NAM database with a new format. 
    The new format is more robust, includes CRC32, additionnal flags, and 
    allows specifiying multiple countries for a same ROM file.
    In addition, while the MEKA database is being repopulated with entries
    in the new format, a high amount of verifications are being done on a
    case by case basis (redump, verified name based on original game media,
    box and manual, analysis of different versions of a same game, etc...).
    I have already redumped more than a hundred games. This will unsure 
    having a near-perfect database after the transition. Old formatted 
    entries are kept during the transition period.
  - SMS-mode Game Gear games are now autodetected and forced to run into
    SMS mode even with a .GG extension. This is because those games are
    often spread with a .GG extension, although there is no way in software 
    to distinguish between a native GG game and one running in SMS mode, 
    since the selection is done via a connected pin in the cartridge itself.
  - Updated file browser:
      - Added dedicated icons to known bad dumps, BIOS images, unofficial
        hacks, homebrew programs (also incorrectly called "public domain"), 
        prototypes and unofficial translation. A translation is defined as 
        a hack whose primary purpose is to alter the language of a game.
        How do you like my icons? 
      - Added European, German, Italian, New-Zealand, Portuguese, Spanish,
        Swedish and United-Kingdom flags. All flags are now displayed with 
        a border, because some themes may choose a window color matching 
        some flags.
      - The "Load Names" feature is now faster and does not verbose any
        data to the message box while loading all files.
      - Made file browser window bigger by default.
      - Removed the auto-generated MEKA.VFN file, which was crap anyway.
        Instead, added a new auto-generated MEKA.FDB file, which store 
        association between user ROM file names and MEKA DataBase entries.
  - Emulation:
      - Emulated VDP 315-5124 behavior of using register 5 bit 0 and 
        register 6 bits 0-1 as masks on sprite x/tile attributes address 
        and tile index. No known game relies on this feature, but it is 
        good for the sake of accuracy and for developpers to check against
        this particularity in their code (it is often a coding mistake). 
        VDP 315-5124 must be selected for that.
  - Updated TECH.TXT with SMS controller pinouts, simple SMS/DB-9 controller 
    adapter instructions from Gary Pierce, and GNU/Linux notes.
  - Various other fixes and code tweaking.

  - Added and modified entries in the checksum and compatibility lists.
      - Naming and database field usage convention has been changed, 
        based on the new format. 
        - "Title (The)" now becomes "Title, The".
        - Unless specified by the game title, "Name: Subtitle" now 
          becomes formatted "Name - Subtitle".
        - A few other things related to versionning/country.
      - Replaced all instances of "Tectoy" by "Tec Toy".
      - Added some missing accents.
      - Added many missing subtitles.
      - Added many new product numbers.
