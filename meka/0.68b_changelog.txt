 ----------
 As an experiment, I have enabled vsync in all default blitters and enabled
 it by default in the GUI. Blitters are still a bit complicated to configure
 so few people seems to actually tweak them or even enable the "smooth" 
 blitter. Does it works better for you?
 I'll be working on synchronisation and blitter improvement (stretching...)
 in the future.

  - Removed the 2-byte tolerance in overdump detection. Overdumps with two
    slighty different half will be added in the database and marked as bad.
  - Emulation:
     - Fixed a major bug in the driver system, which resulted in corrupted
       savestates in F-16 Fighter / F-16 Fighting Falcon (the savestate
       system recognized them as SG-1000 games and so saved only part of RAM).
       Previous ingame states for the game are unrecoverable :(
     - Removed immediate palette update when CRAM is written in a legacy
       video mode (the palette isn't updated on a SMS). It only affected
       F-16 Fighter / F-16 Fighting Falcon, but in a non game-visible way.
     - Tweaked heuristical SMS/GG mapper detection.
     - Fixed SMS/GG scanline counter emulation which was ignoring TV type 
       (NTSC or PAL/SECAM) override directive from the database.
       (eg: one game would be forced to PAL/SECAM mode, but scanline counter 
        emulation still mimic an NTSC system if it is the user selection).
  - Fixed mouse button mapping in the Input Configuration applet.
  - Fixed file browser showing Japanese names after loading SMS Woody Pop
    or GG Pop Breaker (why those games only? because they both have a default 
    country information in the DB, as they only works on Japanese systems).
  - Added and modified entries in the checksum and compatibility lists.
