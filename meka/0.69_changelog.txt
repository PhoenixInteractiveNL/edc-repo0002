 MEKA 0.69
 ---------
  - Updated k.
  - Updated documentation.
  - Added a Memory Editor, long awaited by programmers, hackers and cheaters!
    It allows reading and writing to Z80 memory map, ROM, RAM, VRAM, Palette
    and Battery Backed RAM. Although it is not yet full-featured, it is 
    already very possible to create your own Pro Action Replay codes, and 
    perform various real-time hacks. 
    Please share your questions and hacks on SMS Power forums:

    This tool is the result of joint work with my beloved girlfriend, who
    submitted a first version of it that she developped.
  - Added support for loading and saving pictures in PNG format. PNG is now 
    the default format for screenshots, instead of the badly outdated PCX.
    (thanks to libpng). 
  - Screenshots are now saved in the "Screenshots/" subdirectory.
  - Tweaked some themes, reordered them, removed a few. Themes backgrounds 
    are now in PNG format. Please be sure to download the new picture pack at:

  - [Windows] Added a message console that shows up on startup and magically
    disappear before you have time to read anything. If any problem occurs,
    the console will actually stay to let you read it.
  - [Windows] Fixed runtime application icon that wasn't showing.
  - [Windows] Removed command line parameters uppercase conversion (eg: when 
    ran from Windows explorer). This inconveniently created uppercase output 
    filenames for savestates, screen captures, etc. This was MS-DOS legacy.
  - Slighty optimized VRAM accesses emulation.
  - Incremented message buffer size to cope with SMS Chip-8 Interpreter 1.1
    11k embedded comment. There is still buffer overflows in the code and
    I'm not trying to fix most of them now, so this is just a work-around.
  - Various other fixes and code tweaking.
