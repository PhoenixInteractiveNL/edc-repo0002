1.25.0.1 - 1 Sep 2014
---------------------
Note: This is the last planned version to support Win98/ME.
. The next release of AppleWin will be built with VS2008 Express, so will only work under Windows 2000 and later.

Changes:
. Changed the AppleWin project host from BerliOS to GitHub.
. [Feature #221] Restored F6 original behavior that was changed in v1.22.0.
     F6 Toggle full-screen / windowed mode.
     Ctrl-F6 Toggle windowed 1x/2x zoom.
. Ctrl-PrintScreen will copy the text screen (auto detect 40/80 columns) to the clipboard.
. [Feature #198] Alt-Enter toggles full screen.
. [Feature #199] Added a configuration option "Confirm reboot" to skip the F2 reboot confirmation.
. [Feature #201] Added display of current Track/Sector for the floppy drives.
  - In 2x window mode the status is displayed below the drive LEDs.
  - In full screen mode the status is displayed above the drive LEDS. The track/sector
    is shown only for the last drive accessed.
  Note: DOS3.3 Track/Sector status should be accurate.
        ProDOS support is preliminary -- the track/sector may show zero after an operation.
. Memory initialization defaults to defaults to even pages FF, odd pages 00 (memclear 3).
. Added command line switch to specify the type of memory initialization pattern.
    -memclear #
  Where # ranges from 0 to 7.
  i.e.
     -memclear 0   Initialize memory to zero
     -memclear 1   Initialize memory to random values
     -memclear 2   Initialize memory to 4 byte pattern: FF FF 00 00
     -memclear 3   Initialize memory to even pages FF, odd pages 00
     -memclear 4   Initialize memory to first half page 00, last half page FF
     -memclear 5   Initialize memory to first half page FF, last half page 00
     -memclear 6   Initialize memory to byte offset of that page
                   (current memory address low byte)
                   i.e. 00:00 01 02 03 ... for page $20
     -memclear 7   Initialize memory to page address
                   (current memory address high byte)
                   i.e. 00:20 20 20 20 ... for page $20
  NOTE: -memclear 6 can cause a few programs to NOT function correctly
        due to hidden bugs of programmers not correctly initializing memory or
        using uninitialized memory.  RNDL/RHND and $620B are initialized to
        allow Pooyan, and the Beautiful Boot game launcher to run, along with
        $BFFD..BFFF to allow Copy ][ v5 to boot correctly.
. Debugger (v2.8.0.0):
  - Added: TSAVE "filename" to save the text screen to a file.
    It will auto-detect the current video mode: 40/80 columns.
    Default filename for 40 columns is: AppleWin_Text40.txt
    Default filename for 80 columns is: AppleWin_Text80.txt
 - Changed: DS to ASC because DS is used as a common "Define Space" assembler directive
 - Added: Experimental "ASC" command to mark up data as Apple text.
    using Castle Wolfenstien.DSK
    BLOAD ^VOCAB
    ASC name1 17DA:17F5
 - Fixed: DB address now auto-defines the symbol D_#### if no symbol is given.
 - Fixed: DW address now auto-defines the symbol W_#### if no symbol is given.
 - Fixed: ASB address now auto-defines the symbol T_#### if no symbol is given.
 - Added: Help for DB and DW.

Fixes:
. [Bug #206] Pooyan would freeze due to RNDL/RNDH not initialized to non-zero values on
  a cold boot.
. [Bug #177] Full-screen under Windows8/8.1 would show a corrupt, pastel color palette.
. Debugger:
  - Hang with Memory Fill when memory ends at FFFF, i.e. F D000:FFFF 0
  - Hang with Memory Move when memory ends at FFFF, i.e. 2000<FFFE.FFFFM
