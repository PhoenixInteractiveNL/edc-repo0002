Changes from HU-GO! 2.09 to HU-GO! 2.10

Arrival of a real GUI (using gtk) for both windows and linux ports
  (which includes lot of easiness in changing configuration, ...)
Availability on binary forms for several platforms
FreeBSD port
Improved CD support at pce level
SDL joypad support (for linux only right now)
CD support reenabled for windows (was messed since 2.00 probably)
Rewritten fullscreen support, as well as x2, x3, x4 mode
  in windowed mode.
Lots of bugs fixed in the graphical engine (gunhed works
  after the first level for instance)
Improvement in the sound engine (for rendering noise
  and drums and stereo mode)
Thanks to Ixion, Black-, Cleaner, Zoop and Valerie Tching
  for their very active contribution
