Changes from HU-GO! 2.00 to HU-GO! 2.09

Removed all Allegro references, switched to SDL ! which in itself
  should improve pc compatibility especially in windows.
Improved synchronization (limitation to 60hz rather)
New sound engine (linked to the SDL switch)
Externalized bios (for legal issues)
Somes fixes, this and there
Russian version
